Side Note about Dao Class:
The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is a structural pattern that allows us to isolate the application/business layer from the persistence layer using an abstract API.
The AccountDao and TransactionDao will take care of all actions like get, add, remove and update for account and transaction.
